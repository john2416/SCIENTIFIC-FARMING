    <p style="color:green">About Wheat

      Wheat is the main cereal crop in India. The total area under the crop is about 29.8 million hectares in the
      country. The production of wheat in the country has increased significantly from 75.81 million MT in 2006-07 to
      an all time record high of 94.88 million MT in 2011-12. The productivity of wheat which was 2602 kg/hectare in
      2004-05 has increased to 3140 kg/hectare in 2011-12. The major increase in the productivity of wheat has been
      observed in the states of Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. Higher area coverage is reported from MP in recent
      years.

      Indian wheat is largely a soft/medium hard, medium protein, white bread wheat, somewhat similar to U.S. hard
      white wheat. Wheat grown in central and western India is typically hard, with high protein and high gluten
      content. India also produces around 1.0-1.2 million tons of durum wheat, mostly in the state of Madhya Pradesh.
      Most Indian durum is not marketed separately due to segregation problems in the market yards. However, some
      quantities are purchased by the private trade at a price premium, mainly for processing of higher value/branded
      products.

      The production and productivity of Wheat crop were quite low, when India became independent in 1947. The
      production of Wheat was only 6.46 million tonnes and productivity was merely 663 kg per hectare during 1950-51,
      which was not sufficient to feed the Indian population. The Country used to import Wheat in large quantities for
      fulfilling the needs of our people from many countries like USA under PL-480. The reasons of low production and
      productivity of Wheat at that time was (a) the tall growing plant habit resulting in lodging, when grown under
      fertile soils, (b) the poor tillering and low sink capacity of the varieties used, (c) higher susceptibility to
      diseases, (d) the higher sensitivity to thermo & photo variations, etc., resulting in poor adaptability, and (e)
      longer crop duration resulting in a long exposure of plants to the climatic variations and insect pest / disease
      attacks.

      The Government of India appointed a commission in 1961 to assess the feasibility of increasing the crop
      productivity under prevailing Indian ecological conditions. As result of various steps taken by Govt. of India,
      the Wheat scenario in our country has completely changed. In the post Independence era, country used to import
      Wheat for our needs but due to bumper increase in the production and productivity of Wheat in the 'Green
      Revolution' period in late sixties, our country became self dependent in Wheat production. At present, country is
      producing much more excess Wheat than the requirement and Godowns are over-flooded with Wheat.
      Climate requirement

      Wheat crop has wide adaptability. It can be grown not only in the tropical and sub-tropical zones, but also in
      the temperate zone and the cold tracts of the far north ,beyond even the 60 degree north altitude . Wheat can
      tolerate severe cold and snow and resume growth with the setting in of warm weather in spring .It can be
      cultivated from sea level to as high as 3300 meters.

      The best wheat are produced in areas favoured with cool, moist weather during the major portion of the growing
      period followed by dry, warm weather to enable the grain to ripen properly. The optimum temperature range for
      ideal germination of wheat seed is 20-25 C though the seeds can germinate in the temperature range 3.5 to 35 c.
      Rains just after sowing hamper germination and encourage seedling blight. Areas with a warm and damp climate are
      not suited for wheat growing.

      During the heading and flowering stages, excessively high or low temperatures and drought are harmful to wheat.
      Cloudy weather, with high humidity and low temperatures is conducive for rust attack. Wheat plant requires about
      14-15 c optimum average temperature at the time of ripening . The temperature conditions at the time of grain
      filling and development are very crucial for yield. Temperatures above 250c during this period tend to depress
      grain weight. When temperatures are high, too much energy I lost through the process of transpiration by the
      plants and the reduced residual energy results in poorer grain formation and lower yields. Wheat is mainly a rabi
      (winter) season crop in India.
      Soil

      Wheat is grown in a variety of soils of India. Soils with a clay loam or loam texture, good structure and
      moderate water holding capacity are ideal for wheat cultivation. Care should be taken to avoid very porous and
      excessively drained oils. Soil should be neutral in its reaction. Heavy soil with good drainage are suitable for
      wheat cultivation under dry conditions. These soils absorb and retain rain water well. Heavy soils with poor
      structure and poor drainage are not suitable as wheat is sensitive to water logging. Wheat can be successfully
      grown on lighter soils provided their water and nutrient holding capacity are improved.
      Fertilizer management

      The time and placement of fertilizer is another area where significant progress was made. It was demonstrated
      that 120 kg nitrogen, 60 kg phosphorus and 30 kg potash per hectare were required for optimum productivity. The N
      was to be applied in two split doses of 60 kg as basal and the remaining 60 kg at first irrigation and full
      phosphorus and potash to be applied as basal. Recently, the new wheat varieties have responded up to 180 kg N/ha
      with optima dose around 150 kg/ha. In the Indo-Gangetic plains, application of zinc @ 25kg/ha in rice-wheat
      system was found to increase the yield substantially. Recently, the use of sulphur has been found beneficial for
      enhancing the productivity as well as the grain protein content of wheat. Response to Mn (pockets in the
      Indo-Gangetic plains) and boron (eastern and far eastern region) has also been realized.
      Nutrient management

      With intensive agriculture, deficiency of essential nutrients has also become wide spread. The work conducted
      under the All India Coordinated Research Project on Micronutrient in Crops and Soils, has shown wide spread
      deficiency of zinc in soils in India. At the national level, the deficiency level in micro nutrients is Zn: 46 %,
      B: 17 %, Mo: 12 %, Fe: 11 % and Cu: 5%. The deficiency of sulphur has also been reported across a wide range of
      soils (38%).The yield response to sulphur has been obtained in more than 40 crops including cereal, millets,
      oilseeds and pulses etc.
